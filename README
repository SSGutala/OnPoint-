# Inspiration:
# A prevalent issue in a student's life is successful time management. With a rapidly developing world, time management is a skill 
# required to achieve success and balance in life especially with work. Therefore, to ensure that students are ready for real world speed
# and experiences, our team has decided to develop OnPoint✔ that will generate weekly schedules, for individuals of all ages, to allow 
# students to easily undertake responsibility.

# Future App Developments: 
# Coming up for OnPoint✔ is generating various schedule options for students so that they can choose their most convenient and 
# personalized schedule. We also plan to add a feature in which students can select their favorite schedule out of many unique templates, 
# and edit this schedule as needed. Through this application, we hope to offer students more opportunities to take control of their busy 
# educational journey and become more accountable. Hopefully, this application will also make it less stressful for students while 
# increasing their passion for learning!
